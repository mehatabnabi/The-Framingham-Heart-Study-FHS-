Identifying the risk factors of heart disease

The dataset comprises of predictors such as cholesterol, age, diabetes, and family history that are used to predict the onset of heart disease in a patient.

Analysing the dataset and building a decision tree classifier we can come up with answers to questions such as:
  Are patients with diabetes more likely to develop heart disease at an early age?
  Is there a certain demographic group that is at higher risk of heart disease than others?
  Does frequent exercise lower the risk of developing heart disease?
  Are smokers more likely to develop heart disease than non-smokers?
